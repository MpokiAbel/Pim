# ToDo
## Statistics
- Get Statistics on how many times particular HE operations performs i.e Additions, Multiplications and NTT.
   this will show that accelerating these operation is vital in accelerating the whole HE library.
- Alternatively we could show the equation circuit of different components that make up the HE operations

## Copy operations
- Cast the vector in such a way that modifying the casted vector directly modifies the objects.
