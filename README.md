# Project P4 - Practical Privacy Preserving Processing
In this project we aim to dive but not limited to the following PETs:  
1. Homomophic Encryption  
2. Trusted Execution Environments  
3. Secure Multi-Party Computations  

## Homomophic Encryption (HE)
HE is a technique where computations can be performed on the encrypted data. Projects proposed in this area are as follows:
- [In-Memory Processing on Encrypted Data](HE/PIM/pim.md)
ToDo: Find more possible research directive.

## Trusted Execution Environmets (TEE)
TEE can be see as the secure regions within the CPUs where computations can be done while preserving confidentaility and integrity of the processed data. Projects proposed in this area are as follows:
- [Privacy-Preserving Data Processing in the kernel w/ TEE+eBPF](TEE/eBPF/eBPF.md).  
ToDo: Search for possible research directions on this field

## Secure Multi-Party Computations (sMPC)
sMPC is a paradigm where parties jointly perform a functions over their individual inputs while keeping their inputs private.
No example project for this !! ToDo: Search for possible research directions
