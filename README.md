# Project P4 - Practical Privacy Preserving Processing
In this project we aim to dive but not limited to the following PETs:
1.Homomophic Encryption
2.Trusted Execution Environments
3.Secure Multi-Party Computations

## Homomophic Encryption (HE)
HE is a technique where computations can be performed on the encrypted data. Projects proposed in this area are as follows:
1. [In-Memory Processing on Encrypted Data]()
ToDo: Find more possible research directive.

## Trusted Execution Environmets
TEE can be see as the secure regions within the CPUs. Projects proposed in this area are as follows:
1. Run Privacy-Preserving Data Processing in the kernel w/ TEE+eBPF, e.g., while processing network packets. 
ToDo: Search for possible research directions on this field

## Secure Multi-Party Computations
SMPC is a paradigm where parties jointly perform a functions over their individual inputs while keeping their inputs private.
No example project for this !! ToDo: Search for possible research directions
